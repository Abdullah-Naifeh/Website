                <p class="first">A UX DESIGNER based out of ISTANBUL Currently trying make Blockchain tech.  more accessibe useful and easy to use with @TechFleet-DAO</p>
                <p class="second">I have over 1.5 years of experience working as a UX Designer, specializing in building web applications that delight and empower individuals and organizations.  combined with background of 6 years in the business world and leadership, along with 6 months of training in a Front-End Development Bootcamp with @<a id="recoded" href="https://www.re-coded.com/" target="_blank">Re:coded</a>, I have honed my ability to strike a balance between user needs, business goals, and engineering constraints. This balance is consistently reflected in my designs and their seamless implementation.</p>
                <p class="third">My passion lies in reimagining the intersection between the digital and physical realms. Having grown up with internet, it has played an instrumental role in shaping who I am today. and It’s fuels my desire to contribute towards creating equitable opportunities, and working  toward decentralizing the power and value, all while considering usability and ease of use .
                    I firmly believe that providing a  equitable and  decentralized access to information, technology, and value in general has the transformative power to create a more just and inclusive world.</p>

                <p>I'm curious and problem solver by nature,   I often lose track of time when I dive into learning and exploring new subjects that pique my curiosity, if im not designing If I'm not designing, I enjoy hanging out with people, playing sports, or spend time  planning  out my next adventure, I also enjoy figuring out new interests that fuel my creativity and inspire me to create a future... </p>
